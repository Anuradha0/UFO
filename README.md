The client visits the website and do in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

# Summary

With the help of Data Source. I have created a page that allows you to filter the data by: city, state, country, and shape.

Drawback:
1) User can enter any value into the search boxe
2) Lattitude and Longitude are not included in the search filters. Clients may want to return to the exact location were the UFO was sited.

Recommendations:
1) Make sure that users only search for values that is in the table. 
2) In case, user wants to return to the exact location were the UFO was sited, Lattitude and Longitude can be added in the search filters.
